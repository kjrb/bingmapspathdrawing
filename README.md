Bing Maps Path Drawing Module

Bing Maps Module that uses canvas to draw the line and paint the path along it. 
Support for IE 8 was added with a help of the flash canvas.

Flash canvas link: https://code.google.com/p/flashcanvas/.

Code to crate canvas and adding it to bing map was borrowed from Client Side Heat Map Module for Bing Maps.

The module can be found here:
